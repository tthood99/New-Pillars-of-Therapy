            <h2>What is Occupational Therapy?</h2>
            <p>Occupational Therapy (OT) is a healthcare profession that helps people of all ages participate in the activities they want and need to do through the therapeutic use of everyday activities (occupations). Occupational therapy practitioners enable people of all ages to live life to its fullest by helping them promote health, prevent—or live better with—injury, illness, or disability.</p>
            <p>Common occupational therapy interventions include helping children with disabilities to participate fully in school and social situations, helping people recovering from injury to regain skills, and providing supports for older adults experiencing physical and cognitive changes.</p>
