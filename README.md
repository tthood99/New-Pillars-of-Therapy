Welcome to The Pillars of Occupational Therapy! This website serves as an educational resource about the fundamental principles and practices of occupational therapy for all occupational therapy practitioners.

Occupational therapy is a vital healthcare profession that focuses on enabling people to participate in activities that are meaningful to them (occupations). From children to older adults, occupational therapy practitioners help individuals overcome barriers and achieve their goals through therapeutic use of occupations.

What is Occupational Therapy?

Occupational Therapy (also known as OT) is a healthcare profession that helps people of all ages participate in the activities they want and need to do through the therapeutic use of everyday activities (occupations). Occupational therapy practitioners enable people of all ages to live life to its fullest by helping them promote health, prevent—or live better with—injury, illness, or disability.

Common occupational therapy interventions include helping children with disabilities to participate fully in school and social situations, helping people recovering from injury to regain skills, and providing supports for older adults experiencing physical and cognitive changes, and many more.

The Meaning of "Occupation"

In occupational therapy, "occupations" refer to the everyday activities that people do as individuals, in families, and with communities to occupy time and bring meaning and purpose to life. Occupations include things people need to, want to, and are expected to do. They include:
- Activities of daily living (bathing, dressing, eating, etc.)
- Instrumental activities of daily living (home management, financial management, etc.)
- Rest and sleep
- Education
- Work
- Play and leisure
- Social participation

OT Assessment and Intervention
Occupational therapists use a client-centered approach to assess an individual's abilities, environment, and occupational performance. Interventions may include:
- Developing skills needed for daily activities
- Recommending adaptive equipment and techniques
- Environmental modifications
- Education for clients and caregivers
- Therapeutic activities to improve physical, cognitive, or psychosocial functions

Core Principles of Occupational Therapy

- Client-Centered Practice: Focusing on the client's goals and priorities by actively involving them in the therapeutic process. This ensures interventions are meaningful and relevant to the individual's life.
- Holistic Approach: Considering the whole person, including physical, psychological, and social factors. OT recognizes that health and wellbeing depend on a complex interaction of these factors.
- Occupation-Based Practice: Using meaningful activities as therapeutic tools. The core belief is that engaging in purposeful activities promotes health and wellbeing.
- Evidence-Based Practice: Using current research to guide treatment decisions. OT practitioners integrate clinical expertise with the best available evidence to provide effective interventions.
- Cultural Competence: Respecting and incorporating cultural differences in practice. Understanding how culture influences occupational choices and engagement is essential for effective therapy.
- Therapeutic Use of Self: The therapist's conscious use of their personality, insights, and perceptions as part of the therapeutic process.
- Adaptation: Modifying tasks or environments to promote successful engagement in occupations.
