Welcome to The Pillars of Occupational Therapy! This website serves as an educational resource about the fundamental principles and practices of occupational therapy for all occupational therapy practitioners.

What is Occupational Therapy?

Occupational Therapy (OT) is a healthcare profession that helps people of all ages participate in the activities they want and need to do through the therapeutic use of everyday activities (occupations). Occupational therapy practitioners enable people of all ages to live life to its fullest by helping them promote health, prevent—or live better with—injury, illness, or disability.

Common occupational therapy interventions include helping children with disabilities to participate fully in school and social situations, helping people recovering from injury to regain skills, and providing supports for older adults experiencing physical and cognitive changes.

Core Principles of Occupational Therapy

Client-Centered Practice: Focusing on the client's goals and priorities
Holistic Approach: Considering the whole person, including physical, psychological, and social factors
Occupation-Based Practice: Using meaningful activities as therapeutic tools
Evidence-Based Practice: Using current research to guide treatment decisions
Cultural Competence: Respecting and incorporating cultural differences in practice
